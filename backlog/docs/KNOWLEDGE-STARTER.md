## General Lessons Learned
*   [STARTER] **Validation First**: Always run a build check (`npm run build`) before committing changes to ensure no regressions were introduced.
*   [STARTER] **Workflow Adherence**: When a workflow (like `@[/start-task]`) has explicit stops or notification steps, respect them. Do not auto-advance past critical user checkpoints.
*   [STARTER] **Knowledge Check**: Before asking "how do I do X?", check this file. It often contains project-specific patterns that override general best practices.
*   [STARTER] **Task Boundaries**: Keep tasks focused. If you find a bug unrelated to your current task, log a new task instead of fixing it inline (unless critical).
